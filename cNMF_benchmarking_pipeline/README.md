# cNMF Pipeline

![Pipeline Flowchart](./flowchart.png)

## Overview
End-to-end pipeline for running and evaluating (with visualization) consensus Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cNMF) on single-cell data with perturbation.

## Components

### Inference
- **sk-cNMF**: CPU-based implementation using scikit-learn
- **torch-cNMF**: GPU-accelerated implementation using PyTorch


### Perturbation calibration
- For each dataset, perform a calibration test to generate a null distribution with non-targeting guides, and test if the p-value calculation is well calibrated. 
    - generate fake p-values by randomly selecting some non-targeting guides to be targeting, perform a perturbation test. 
    - the fake p-values vs uniform p-value distribution qqplot, the fake p-values need to be aligned in diagonal 
    - Then, the real p-values vs the uniform p-value distribution qqplot, the real p-values need to be rarer
		1. If pass, proceed to downstream analysis 
		2. If failed, change the p-value calculation method


### Evaluation
Comprehensive evaluation metrics including:
- Categorical association analysis
- Perturbation sensitivity testing (default U-test)
- Motif & geneset enrichment
- Trait enrichment analysis
- GO enrichment analysis
- Genesets enrichment analysis
- Explained variance calculation
- Reconstruction error
- stability metrics

### Plotting
Quality control and analysis visualization tools:
- K-selection plots for optimal K selection
- Compare Model plots for comparing sk-cNMF vs torch-cNMF results 
- Program quality control plots visulization 
- Perturbed gene analysis visualization

## Usage
1. Run inference using either sk-cNMF or torch-cNMF
2. Perform the perturbation sensitivity test and test if p-values are well calibrated
3. Evaluate results using the evaluation pipeline
4. Generate plots for analysis and quality control and compile results into Excel summary tables
