# cNMF Evaluation Pipeline

Comprehensive evaluation metrics for cNMF program quality assessment across multiple biological and technical dimensions.

## Overview

The evaluation pipeline tests cNMF programs against various criteria to assess their biological relevance and technical quality. Each program is systematically evaluated using statistical tests and enrichment analyses.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion    | Implementation | External resource | Interpretation | Caveats |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Goodness of fit  | [Explained variance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score.html) per program | None | A program explaining more variance in the data might represent dominant biological variation. | Technical variation might be the highest source of variance (e.g. batch effects). |
| Variation across category levels | [Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance) + Dunn's posthoc test | None | If program scores are variable between batch levels then the component likely is modelling technical noise. Alternatively, if program scores are variable between a biological category like cell-type or condition then the program is likely modelling a biological process specific to the category. | If batches are confounded with biological conditions, then the relative contribution of technical and biological variation cannot be decomposed. |
| Gene-set enrichment | [GSEA](https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) using program x feature scores | MsigDB, Enrichr | If a program is significantly associated with a gene-set then it could explain the biological process the program represents | |
| Motif enrichment | Pearson correlation of motif counts per gene (promoter or enchancer) and program x gene scores | HOCOMOCO v12 | If genes with high contributions to a program are also enriched with same enhancer/promoter motifs they could be co-regulated | A biological pathway could involve genes with different regulation but still contribute to a common function | 
| Trait enrichment | [Fisher's exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) | OpenTargets database | If a program is significantly associated with a trait then it could explain the biological process the program represents | |
| Perturbation sensitivity | Mann-Whitney U test of program scores between perturbed cells and non-targeted/reference cells | Perturbation data | Cell x programs score distribution shifts greater than expected due to the direct effect of perturbation on genes in the program could indicate hierarchical relationships b/w genes in the program | Expression of genes upstream of the perturbed gene are unlikely to be affected |
